Requirements:
- Apache 2.0 or higher (not tested with 1.* but might work)
- PHP 5 or higher
- GD (imaging module for PHP, ues phpinfo() to check if it's installed)

Installation:
- Copy all files and subdirectories to a web-accessable folder (for example /www/mydisplay)
- Rename config.example.php to config.php and change the settings in it (see the file itself for information)
- Rename settings.example.txt to settings.txt and change it:
  * cp.imagedir should point to the folder where coppermine stores your pictures
  * cp.user should be the database username that has access to the coppermine database
  * cp.password should be set to the password for that user
  * cp.db to the database name
  * cp.dbserver to the server name (typically 'localhost')
- If you're on Linux, chown the cache/ folder and settings.txt to your www-user (on Debian: www-data) and chmod them both 777
- If you're using a webserver other than Apache, make sure that you make settings.txt inaccessible from outside, or else your database password
  can be seen.
